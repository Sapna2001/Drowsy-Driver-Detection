# Drowsy-Driver-Detection
Drowsiness is a major cause of road accidents. Our project is an attempt to reduce the number of accidents occurring due to driver drowsiness.

## Problem Statement
Driver's inattention might result from a lack of alertness when driving due to driver drowsiness and distraction. Unlike driver distraction, driver 
drowsiness involves no triggering event but is characterized by a progressive withdrawal of attention from the road and traffic demands. Both driver 
drowsiness and distraction might have the same effects. That is, decreased driving performance, longer reaction time, and an increased risk of crash 
involvement. 

## Solution
A Python based Drowsy Driver Detection System is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fall asleep while driving. 
It will detect that the driver's eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
